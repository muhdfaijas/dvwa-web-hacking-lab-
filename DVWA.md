# 🔐 DVWA Web Hacking Lab – My Pentesting Journey

Welcome to my personal hacking lab using **DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)**.  
This repo documents my step-by-step write-ups for exploiting various web application vulnerabilities from **Low to High security levels**.

🧠 **Hands-on > Theory.**  
No degree. Just pure focus, skills, and results.
